== Work in progress

JBake site for https://restall.io[restall.io]

Template based on https://github.com/BlackrockDigital/startbootstrap-clean-blog[startbootstrap-clean-blog]

The blog uses https://github.com/google/code-prettify[code-prettify] for syntax highlighting.


== Usage

If you want to use my blog as a starting point to create a similar JBake blog it's dead easy.

Firstly you should familiarise yourself with http://jbake.org/[JBake]. I have tried not to hard code anything specific to my blog into the template, so you should only need to modigy `jbake.properties` and and your own content.

My content is all written in http://asciidoctor.org/[Asciidoc] but you can use any format you wish.

=== Gradle

TODO: explain how to use current gradle config, to generate site and publish it

=== Adding new pages

To add a new page copy `projects.adoc` a new link should appear in the menu bar at the top automatically.


== TODO
* Write some blog posts
* Remove dependencies on other sites. E.G. Google Fonts
* Add Disqus
* Add WebP support to template

== Blog Post Ideas
* Why JBake?
  ** Why Asciidoctor?
  ** Why freemarker
* Understanding Java logging libraries
* Learning clojure
* Automated builds are not CI
* Projects that are easy to start are often hard to maintain
* Obvious solutions aren't easy to find
* Blog post meta
  ** Keeping posts short, better to split a long posts into many parts
* Tech test & interview thoughts
  ** What to look for
  ** Asking candidates to solve specific open source issues
* Prox-t
* Greeb
* Migrating Greeb to Kotlin
* X Minute read
  ** Implementing in
  ** Downsides
    *** Different reading speeds
    *** Different comprehension speeds
    *** Takes longer to read and understand code examples
  ** Upsides
    *** Give the reader an idea of how long the post it
  ** Alternatives
    *** Has to be in a unit that is easy for the reader to understand
* Brain dump blogs posts
  ** Keep them short
  ** note them with brain dump
  ** revisit them, you'll probanly change your mind on it after some more thought
* How to affect peoples perception of others.
* Data types in java
  ** Precompiler that generates them
* Let things fail
  ** Propping things up and continuing doesn't help in the long run
* API Design
